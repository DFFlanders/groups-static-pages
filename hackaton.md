Running a Hackathon is to benefit both operators and developers who want to learn OpenStack AND experienced OpenStack devOps who want to teach new batch of stackers. To run a Hackathon, you will need the following experience

- You will need to know how to use and navigate openstack, python, git, maven, launchpad, gerrit, jenkins, and zuul. The OpenStack Install Guide and the OpenStack Training Guides are great sources to source build OpenStack. The rest of the tools are a bit more completed. The OpenStack community training can get you started http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/training-guide/content/getting-tools-and-accounts.html. Running a Hackathon will require some real experience of how these tools work and interoperate.
- Once you have some of the basic experience you will need to connect with a user group if you are not already running one. See above on details OpenStackUserGroups
- Each Hackathon will need at least one person ready to help the "students" with problems. Hackathons are hands on "teaching" and learning sessions.
